This project demonstrates the use of R Programming for generating presentation slides and reports. Using the RMarkdown package, we can create interactive and visually appealing:<br/>

•   Presentation slides
•	HTML reports
•	PDF reports

Types of Presentations in R Programming
RMarkdown supports the creation of three types of presentations:
1.	Slidy-Presentation
2.	ioslides-Presentation
3.	Beamer-Presentation
Interactive Features in R Programming
R offers several packages for creating interactive content, such as:
•	DT: Enables interactive data tables, allowing users to explore data dynamically.
•	ggplot2: A powerful package for creating high-quality, static visualizations.
•	plotly: Adds interactivity to 2D and 3D graphs. It also allows users to transform static ggplot2 visualizations into interactive ones using the ggplotly() function.
•	leaflet: Facilitates the creation of interactive maps, enabling users to add pins and mark locations with ease.
Extra Features in ioslides-Presentation
This PPT was created using the ioslides-Presentation format in RMarkdown, which offers several unique features:
•	Browser-based Presentation: The slides open directly in a web browser for easy sharing and presenting.
•	Table of Contents Navigation: Pressing c during the presentation displays the table of contents, which can be used to navigate between slides.
•	Dynamic Text Resizing: 
o	Press b to make the slide text larger. The content is automatically paraphrased and realigned for better readability.
o	Press s to shrink the text size.
•	HTML Conversion: Press a during the presentation to convert the slides into an HTML web report for online sharing.
